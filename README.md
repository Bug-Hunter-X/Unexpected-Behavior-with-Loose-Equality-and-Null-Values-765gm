# JavaScript Bug: Loose Equality and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and the handling of null values.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected comparisons between different data types, especially when dealing with null or undefined values.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function that demonstrates this issue.  Without proper null checks, unexpected behavior can occur when either 'a' or 'b' are null.  Incorrect null handling can lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, explicitly checking for null values before performing the comparison. This approach ensures that the function handles null inputs gracefully, preventing errors and maintaining correct logic.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` and observe the behavior with various inputs, including null values.
3. Compare the output with the results obtained from running `bugSolution.js`.
